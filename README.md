# SwiftCurlUI

Use ChatGPT to create a macOS GUI for curl.

Motivations:

1. See how fast this kind of UI work can be done (the core functionality already exists, the complete spec is in the man page, this is just about making a nice UI quickly)

2. Being annoyed with the completely pointless "you need to make a profile!" addition to certain existing curl GUIs

Note:

Given the motivation (and currently being the only developer), there's not much point developing off the main branch. As it's still important to record the weaknesses as well as the strengths, this includes non-compiling and indeed buggy commits â€” obviously it would be a terrible idea to push breaking commits on main for serious projects, don't do that.
