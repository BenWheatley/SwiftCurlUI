# SwiftCurlUI

Use ChatGPT to create a macOS GUI for curl.

Motivations:

1. See how fast this kind of UI work can be done (the core functionality already exists, the complete spec is in the man page, this is just about making a nice UI quickly)

2. Being annoyed with the completely pointless "you need to make a profile!" addition to certain existing curl GUIs
